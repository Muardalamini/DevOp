The image shows a **Dockerfile**, which is used to create a container for a Python web application. Here’s a simple explanation of each part:

1. FROM python:3.10  
   - Starts with a base image that has Python version 3.10 installed. This is the environment where your app will run.

2. ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1  
   - Ensures that Python outputs immediately show in the terminal, which helps with debugging.

3. WORKDIR /code**  
   - Sets the current working directory to `/code` inside the container. All files will be placed and run from here.

4. COPY requirements.txt . 
   - Copies the `requirements.txt` file (which lists your app’s dependencies) from your computer into the `/code` directory inside the container.

5. RUN pip install -r requirements.txt**  
   - Installs all the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

6. COPY . .  
   - Copies all files from your project directory into the `/code` directory inside the container.

7. EXPOSE 8000  
   - Opens port 8000 to allow access to the web app from outside the container.

8. CMD [ "python", "manage.py", "runserver" ]  
   - When the container starts, this command runs the Django web server (`manage.py runserver`), making the app accessible.

In short, this file prepares the container to run a Django app on port 8000.

The command in the image is:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Simple Explanation:

This command is used to **start** and **build** all the services (like web apps, databases, etc.) defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. Here's what each part does:

1. **`docker compose up`**:  
   - This starts all the containers defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. It brings the entire environment up, running all services (such as databases, web servers, etc.) at once.

2. **`--build`**:  
   - This option tells Docker to **rebuild** the images before starting the containers, even if the image already exists. It ensures any changes in the code or the Dockerfile are applied.

### Example Use Case:
If you have a web app and a database, and you made changes to your app code, running `docker compose up --build` will:
- Rebuild the app's Docker image with the new changes.
- Start both the app and the database together in the right configuration. 

It's useful for ensuring your containers always run with the latest version of your code.
